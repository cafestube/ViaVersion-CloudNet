# ViaVersion-CloudNet-Proxy

With the default ViaVersion implementation new services are not pinged automatically and CloudNet services can not be instantly connected with.
By using this plugin on the backend servers and on the proxy ViaVersion will automatically know how to handle these services.

Using ViaVersion on sub servers will be the better solution for most people. But in instances where you need ViaVersion on the proxy(e.g. in
combination with Minestom) this could solve this issue.
